The different temperatures of stars are classified by the sequence of letters O, B, A, F, G, K, M, that goes from hot to cold. For most stars, there is a relation between the mass of the star and their surface temperature. For example, an average G-type star (also called a yellow dwarf) has roughly 0.84 to 1.15 solar masses (our Sun is 1 solar mass).
